== Fuzzy ==

This is a Rand-r TCP fuzzer experimental program, you can get the code from the cpp file

How it works:

The program takes a random binery junk from the random virtual device 
(/dev/random/) and shoot it to a remote TCP listiner port 

Does it work better then regular string based fuzzer ?:

No clue, thats the experiment :)
